	<h1>Roberto Campos</h1>
		<p> If you are here it’s because you are reading through my resume and decided to invest in me. Allow me to briefly tell you about myself, I am currently a computer science student at Sacramento State University. When you take a glimpse at me at plain sight you might think that I couldn’t possibly be a computer science student. You wouldn’t have thought that someone like me graduated with a nearly 4.0 high school GPA or that I have earned being on the dean’s honor list twice. You would have never guessed that I’ve experienced being a D1 Athlete. You would have never guessed that I am on track to graduate in four years.</p> 

<p>You may be asking why I am mentioning all of this. Simple. I am determined, disciplined and I have a competitive spirit. I am self-motivated to develop personally, as well as professionally. I am always seeking to learn from others, I believe we all have something special to share with the world. If we are willing to listen, people are willing to share their experiences. Listening has saved me a lot of time, and I have acquired a vast amount of wisdom. I believe that my willingness to learn and allowing myself to be mentored and helped has allowed me to achieve all these accomplishments. </p>

<p>You’ve read this far, so you deserve to know an important detail about myself. I am comfortable being able to share that I am a dreamer. I am a DACA recipient, and with all this chaos going on it’s important to speak up. Share, that we are incredible citizens that want to give back to the community in which we grew up in. It is something that I am proud of, it has made me who I am. It has fueled me to continue to strive forward. <p>

<p>But, don’t let this distract you. I am a capable engineer who doesn’t back away from a challenge. </p>
	<p> All I need is an <em>opportunity</em> </p>
